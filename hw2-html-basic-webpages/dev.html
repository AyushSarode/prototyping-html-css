        <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
        <p>First we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Add a "ul elements (it stands for unordered list</p></li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" elements</li>
            <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Notice the new "ol" elements wrapping everything</li>
            <li>But, the list items elements are the same</li>
            <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
            <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

        <p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS soon.</p>
