  </h2>

      Napping
    </li>
    <li>
      Stressing
    </li>
    <li>
      Ordering food like I'm responsible for the economony
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>trying new recipes</li>
    <li>
      making plans for when this is all over
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
  </ol>
<h2>Inline Element</h2>
