	<h1>interneting is easy!</h1>
	<p>first, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>
	<h2>headings</h2>
	<p>headings define the outline of your site. there are six levels of headings.</p>
	<h2>lists</h2>
	<p>this is how you make an unordered list:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
		<li>add each item in its own "li" element</li>
		<li>they don't need to be in any particular order</li>
	</ul>
	<p>this is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
		<li>but, the list item elements are the same</li>
		<li>also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
		<li>you should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>inline elemens</h2>
	<p><em>sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase</p>
	<p>other times, you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
	<p><em><strong>and sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>
	<h2>empty elements</h2>
	<p>thanks for reading! interneting should be getting easier now</p>
	<p>regards,<br/>the authors</p>

	<p>P.S. this page might look like crap, but we'll learn how to fix that with some CSS soon.</p>
