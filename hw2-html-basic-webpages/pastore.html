            <h1>Interneting is Easy</h1>

<p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

<h2>Headings</h2>
<p>Headings define the outline for your site. There are six levels of headings. </p>
<h2>lists</h2>

<p>This is how you make an unordered list</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a "ul" element</li>
<li>Add each item in its own "li" element </li>
<li>They dont need to be in any particular order</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what an ordered list looks like</p>

<ol>
    <li>Notice the new "li" element rapping everything</li>
    <li> But the elements are the same</li>
    <li> Also notice how the numbers incremenet on their ownn</li>
    <li> You should be noticing thing in percise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
</ol>

<h2> Inline Elements</h2>

<p><em>Sometimes </em>you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase </p>
<p>This is some<em>emphasized text</em></p>
<p>Other times you need <em>strong</em>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase </p>
<p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>
