# Basic Web Pages Homework

After you set up your coding environment by following James' Introduction, follow along with his Basic Web Pages activity.

Yet, before you start this activity, please review this [Github Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) about how to: 

- **Fork** this repository
- **Clone** the Forked repo
- After you make changes to the code on your computer, **pushing those changes to your *cloned* code**, and 
- **Submitting your Cloned repo** as a Pull Request to this original repo. 

You will follow this process as you add your individual HTML file to the repo.

Then, once you've forked and cloned this repo, add your HTML file and name it “```lastname.html```”, where "lastname" will be your last name. For example, my homework file would be named "```lindgren.html```"
