# Semantic HTML Homework

As you read James' Semantic HTML, do the following:

1. Create a __**__new folder__**__ and name it, "<code>semantics-lastname</code>", where "lastname" is your last name.
2. In this new folder, follow the remainder of James' "SETUP" instructions and create a <code>article.html</code> file.
3. Follow his lead as he goes through the fundamentals. However, I would like you to put each section from the chapter inside its own &lt;section&gt;...&lt;/section&gt; block element.
4. Label each section with James' provided subheading and mark it up with a level 2 heading block element: &lt;h2&gt;...&lt;/h2&gt;.
5. Be sure to practice good tag naming and indentation schemes.
6. When you're done, commit and push your code to the ENGL-4814 org's repo.
