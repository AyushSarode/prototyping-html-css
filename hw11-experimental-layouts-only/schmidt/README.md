# Nicole's own website

I decided to create a website about activities one can do when visiting Washington, D.C.
I live near the city and have done some of this stuff myself. Since we cannot go outside I thought it would be nice to have this site of things to do once we are all allowed back out. In a perfect world I could run a site like this and make money by advertising certain companies but for now I'll stick to engineering. After doing this exercise I might end up helping some friends create websites of their own someday.

Below is the image of my wireframe I created.
