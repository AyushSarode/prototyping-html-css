#Experimental Layout

**[Website Wireframe](borg/assets/images/wireframe.jpg)

**Description of Website:
This website was a fun exploration of fashion, utilizing mostly images of some experimental looks that I love. This webpage is the homepage of a hypothetical fashion blog, "LogoIpsum." I used a minimalistic design on my website, to keep in line with the experimental nature of the looks. I designed the page according to a two-column grid, but broke the grid in some areas with type to keep the experimental appearance. I also created the line gif at the end of my page, to add some interaction to the page.
