# Experimental Flexible Layout!

## Logistics

**Goal**: Cap off the semester by expressing yourself through your own site with a flexible layout. 

Here are some considerations:

- Come up with your own thematic site of your choosing. Find inspiration in the wild, again, and make it your own. Practice what Jen Simmons does by looking beyond web design itself, such as graphic design or architecture for inspiration.
- Gather up your own assets (images, videos, sounds, etc.), 
- Wireframe your idea, and 
- Based on your wireframe, code it with CSS Grid. 
- Meaningfully integrate text with your media
- Apply a simple color scheme (3-4 colors)
- Apply a typography scheme.
- Apply some metadata tags in the ```head```
- Apply good folder and file-naming schemes.

**DO NOT** simply copy-paste code, if available. This is considered plagiarism in this situation, since I am asking you to distill the overall design. You may find useful patterns to integrate, but be sure to meaningfully organize your HTML and CSS files.

**Due**: End of the semester: May 12th, 11:59pm.

Follow this procedure:

1. Create your own folder within this root folder, as follows:
  1. Create a new folder with the name: <code>lastname</code>, where "lastname" is your last name. 
     - **NOTE** the example folder with my name: <code>lindgren</code>. AHEM, all lowercase. ;-)
  2. Inside your specific folder,
      1. Create an ```index.html``` file and ```README.md``` file.
      2. Create an <code>assets</code> folder with a ```.keep``` file.
      3. Inside <code>assets</code>, create a <code>css</code> folder.
      4. Inside <code>css</code>, create a <code>style.css</code> file.
      5. Inside <code>assets</code>, create folder(s) for your media, as needed. For example, if you have more than just images, you can create a <code>media</code> folder. Then, inside of it, you can create an <code>images</code> folder and any other media-type. 
          - **NOTE**: GH repos can only contain files less than 50mb, and I do not recommend using any large files anyway.
2. Once you create this basic structure, then wireframe your layout and plan your site content. (See the <code>/wireframes</code> folder.)
3. Once your wireframe is complete, add an image of the wireframe to your <code>images</code> folder.
4. Embed this image in your README.md file with an image tag with a short description of your site.
5. Once you've completed your site, push the changes to the organization's repo.
