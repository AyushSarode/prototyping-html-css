# CSS Selection Homework

After you read James' CSS Selection, do the following:

1. Create a __**__new folder__**__ and name it, "<code>lastname</code>", where "lastname" is your last name.
2. In this new folder, follow James' "SETUP" instructions and create a <code>selectors.html</code> file and a <code>style.css</code> file. 
   - **Please use all lowercase for your folder and file names.**
3. Follow his lead as he goes through CSS selection fundamentals. However, I would like you to put each section from the chapter inside its own &lt;section&gt;...&lt;/section&gt; block element.
4. Label each section with James' provided subheading and mark it up with a level 2 heading block element: &lt;h2&gt;...&lt;/h2&gt;.
5. When you're done, commit and push your code.
