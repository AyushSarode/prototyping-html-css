# CSS Box Model Homework

After you read James' chapter on the CSS Box Model, do the following:

## 1. Open the index.html file into your browser. (Chrome or Firefox for this lesson works fine.)

## 2. Inspect each element on the page with the Inspector Tool. You should see something like the below image:

<img src="assets/img/inspector-box-model.png" alt="Screen capture that shows the result of the third step." />

## 3. Inspection assignment goals

The goal of this inspection assignment is to become acquainted and familiar with the following:

1. The inspector tools and windows: What windows tell you what types of information? How and why might that be important?
2. Become familiar with box model behavior, and how CSS enables you to write rules to change the default element behaviors.

No need to push anything back. I just want you to experiment with the inspector tools.
